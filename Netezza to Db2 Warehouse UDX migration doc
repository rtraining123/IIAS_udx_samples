In Netezza UDX were deployed using nzudxcompile. The below command would compile and register the cube.cpp as a function CUBE in Netezza.

nzudxcompile cube.cpp --sig "Cube(int4)" --return INT8 --class Cube --user myuser --pw password --db mydb


However, In Db2 Warehouse , particularly on Db2 Warehouse on Cloud this done differently. The reason being there is no direct access
to loading files and invoking the compiler on this platform. Instead we provide CLPPLUS based IDA commands which can compile and register
the UDX on Db2 Warehouse.

To achieve the same in Db2 Warehouse/IIAS/Db2 Warehouse on Cloud you can follow the below commands.

>tar cvf cube.tar cube.cpp
>ida deployudx source cube.tar proj udxproj sig cube(int) return int fenced yes det yes nullcall yes 
  parallel yes class Cube
  
  The above ida command pushes the file to the connected instance. Compiles it. Deploys the UDX binary files in the appropriate location
  on the instance and registers the UDX on the database.
  
  Once this command is successfully complete, users can run this UDX.
  
  >select cube(c1) from T1
